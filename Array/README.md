## Arrays
In this repo, we take arrays head-on, forming a strong foundation for tackling a wide array of programming challengesðŸ˜„. From finding the Two Sum or the Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock to more complex tasks like solving the 3 Sum problem or uncovering the Minimum in a Rotated Sorted Array, we're here to sharpen our problem-solving skills and unlock the full potential of arrays. So, whether you're a seasoned coder looking to refine your array expertise or a newcomer eager to learn, this will be fun.

### 1. `twoSums`
Given an array of integers **nums** and an integer **target**, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to **target**.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

> Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
> Output: [0,1]
> Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

> Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6

> Output: [1,2]

Example 3:

> Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6

> Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

> 2 <= nums.length <= 104

> -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

> -109 <= target <= 109
